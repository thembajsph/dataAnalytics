# Python Pro Features

*[**Note**: Ongoing work, one commit at time. I would like creating my own version of all topics mentioned in below outline, but I due to other commitments, I can't promise I will. If I am unable to create content for a given topic, I will link some external good resources. I also compiled resources for further learning(see further learning). Feedback or suggestion for other good Python resources are welcome]*

Python is a popular programming language that emphasizes efficiency, readability and simplicity ahead of anything. Due to its rich standard library, it has been called "a battery included" language.

This repository is a home of Python most advanced concepts and features. It's an extension of a former repository of [Python basics](https://github.com/Nyandwi/PythonBasics).
