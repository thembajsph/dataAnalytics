    "Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm or feature that allows developers to structure programs into classes and objects. OOP gives the developers the ability to design programs around data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are new data type that you can create yourself. Objects can be created from the Class. A typical class has two components: `fields` (or variables) that store data and `methods`(or functions) that operate on those data. Python [glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html) defines class as a template for creating user defined objects and object\n",
    "as any data with state(attribute or value) and defined behavior(methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the simplicity of Python and the thousands of features it provides that can be used on the fly, the majority of Python developers doesn't need to use OOP. However, it is important to understand OOP so that you can understand when and when not to use it. OOP provides modularity and reusability. Take an example: Python list is a built-in object. Imagine how many time you(and other millions of coders) use list with different data!! That's extreme reusability!!\n",
    "\n",
    "When should you use class or function? This is a hard questions, but generally if you found yourself using a number of functions over and over on same data, then you should consider using class for reusability. If on the otherhand you are creating a class with methods that you will use once, it's probably better to use normal functions. Here is a great talk about that: [Stop Using Classes ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) by Jack Diederich. You can also learn more about the critism of OOP [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Criticism).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you plan to build an API(Application Protocol Interface) one day, it's very likely that you will need to structure data and methods in a systematic way. So, OOP is an important thing to know. "
